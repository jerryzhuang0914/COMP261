# Fourier transform

The goal of this assignment is to write a program that implements the

• Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT),

• Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT),

• Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and

• Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT),

which is a very powerful tool in signal processing.
