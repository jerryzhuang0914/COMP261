Assignment 3 of COMP261 2021T1

The goal of this assignment is to write a program that implements the
• Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT),
• Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT),
• Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and
• Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT),
which is a very powerful tool in signal processing.
